# UFOS

## Overview of Project
Our client Dana has asked us to create a webpage for her to showcase one of her favorite topics, UFO sightings. She has provided us with a large data file of all the recorded sightings that she has been able to put together and wants to make them available for other UFO enthusiasts to look up and enjoy. The webpage should showcase the data, as well as allow the user to look specific sightings.

## Results
The webpage I created is user friendly in the sense that it is only one page so there is no other pages to click to, all information will be visible on the home screen.
There is a brief introduction under the header about aliens and sightings, that invites the user to review the information themselves and decide how they feel about aliens.

Underneath the introduction, the user will find that the first sixteen sightings are listed, but to the left of that information is where the user can interact with the website. In the "Filter Search", section the user can look for sightings on a given day, city, state, country or by shape. They can even use all the filters to find specific sightings.

The user may choose as many filters as they would like to add to query, for example if they only wanted to find the sightings in Arizona, they would only need enter "AZ."

The user can then read the description of the sighting.

## Summary
The website showcases what our client wanted to display and allows for searching, however a drawback that I would point out about the design is that if one needs to change their search criteria, one has to delete what they input. It would be cleaner to have a "clear all" button to fix that. Also the information is dynamic so it does change with user input, but adding a "search" button when the user is done inputing their criteria would be clean it up more.
